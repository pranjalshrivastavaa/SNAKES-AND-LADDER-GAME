# SNAKES-AND-LADDER-GAME
This Snakes and Ladders game built using Python, integrating both game logic and visual representation with Turtle graphics. The game follows a turn-based system where two players roll a dice to move forward on a 10x10 grid. If a player lands on a ladder, they climb up, while landing on a snake causes them to slide down. The objective is to reach position 100 first. The board is drawn using the Turtle module, and player movements are animated for a more engaging experience. The game logic ensures that players do not exceed the final position, and it checks for win conditions after each turn. Potential improvements include adding a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or Pygame, enhancing the board with numbered cells and images for snakes and ladders, introducing sound effects, and supporting more players with different colors. This project serves as a great combination of logic, graphics, and user interaction, making it an excellent choice for learning Python and game development. ðŸš€
